## Background
The data being used consists of various listings of AirBnB in Bangkok, Thailand. This dataset includes information such as listing name, host details, neighborhood of listing, room type, pricing, reviews, and more. The primary focus is to optimise pricing for AirBnB listings in order to maximise revenue. 

The dataset includes key details of various AirBnB listings in Bangkok, featuring information such as name, host details, neighborhood, room type, pricing, reviews, and more. The primary focus is on optimizing pricing strategies for enhanced revenue generation. Using insights from this dataset, the business aims to uncover correlations between factors like neighborhood, room type, and review activity and analyse their impact on listing prices. The goal of this analysis is to strike a balance between competitive pricing and maximizing occupancy rates, ultimately optimizing the overall profitability of the AirBnB venture.

## Business Problems
In order to optimise the price of AirBnB listings in Bangkok, there are two crucial questions that need to be answered:
1. Are the prices of the listings fair?
2. What are some factors that can affect the popularity of the listings?

The Jupyter notebook files attached will guide us through the process of data analysis of these listings, in an attempt to answer the questions that we have asked above.

## Files
There are several files in this repository:
1. Two Jupyter notebook files:
  - **Data Cleaning.ipynb**

  - **Airbnb Listings Bangkok_clean.csv** (Dataset after cleaning)
3. A PDF file, **Airbnb Listings Bangkok Dictionary.pdf**, which explains the variables given in the dataset.
